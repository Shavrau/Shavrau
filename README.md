Hi there! My name is Rhian and I am currently pursuing a degree in Multiplatform Software Development at FATEC MatÃ£o. I have a strong interest in technology and I am always looking to learn more about the latest developments in the field.

Some of my skills include programming in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as knowledge of developing applications on the Azure platform. Although I do not have professional experience yet, I am always looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and grow in the field of technology.

I am excited to explore new possibilities and work on challenging projects. If you are looking for a developer with a passion for technology and a willingness to learn, please don't hesitate to contact me.
